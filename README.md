# Flutter Introduction

SDK Flutter Introduction.

## Getting Started

How to create a new Flutter application Step-by-Step:  
  > 1. Write _import 'material...'_ and press Enter -> needed to use Material Widgets (button, ...).
  > 2. _void main() => runApp(YourAppName())_ -> runApp runs YourAppName (you need to "generate
       it" as a class that extends StatelessWidget -> see 3.).
  > 3. Create a new class - YourAppName - that extends StatelessWidget and implement build method.
  > 4. In the build method write "return MaterialApp(...);".
  > 5. Inside "MaterialApp(...)" define the attribute _home_ -> _home: Scaffold()_ (which means "
       create a Scaffold and insert it in the MaterialApp home attribute").

Flutter is a software development toolkit (SDK) from Google for building cross-platform apps.  
Flutter is _not_ a language -> Flutter uses *Dart* as its programming language (object-oriented).  
Flutter's widgets exist parallel to native widgets due to its customer user interface rendering
engine - *Skia* - ensuring native performance.  
*IDE* (Integrated Development Environment): XCode for iOS and Android Studio for Android.  

The Flutter architecture consists of three main layers:  
 > 1. The Framework layer is written in Dart and contains the high-level libraries that youâ€™ll use directly to build apps. This includes the UI theme, widgets, layout and animations, gestures and foundational building blocks. Alongside the main Flutter framework are plugins: high-level features like JSON serialization, geolocation, camera access, in-app payments and so on. This plugin-based architecture lets you include only the features your app needs.
 > 2. The Engine layer contains the core C++ libraries that make up the primitives that support Flutter apps. The engine implements the low-level primitives of the Flutter API, such as I/O, graphics, text layout, accessibility, the plugin architecture and the Dart runtime. The engine is also responsible for rasterizing Flutter scenes for fast rendering onscreen.
 > 3. The Embedder is different for each target platform and handles packaging the code as a stand-alone app or embedded module.
  
In Flutter almost everything that makes up the user interface is a Widget.  
There are two main types of Widget:  
->  __StatelessWidget__: (*"Widget without state"*)  
> a Stateless Widget doesn't change after you build it.   
'''
class MyStlessWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyStlessWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }
}
'''

->  __StatefulWidget__: (*"Widget with state"*)  
> a Stateful widget change his state during the lifetime of the Widget.  
'''
class MyStfulWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const MyStfulWidget({Key? key}) : super(key: key);
  @override
  _MyStfulWidgetState createState() => _MyStfulWidgetState();
}
class _MyStfulWidgetState extends State<MyStfulWidget> {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Container();
  }
}
'''

__main()__ is the entry point for the code when the app launches.  
__runApp()__ main method that tells Flutter which is the top-level widget for the app (everything in
Flutter start with a widget -> runApp() takes the root Widget).  

- a Widget's __build()__ method is the entry point for composing together other widgets to make a
  new widget. Every StatelessWidget must override build() method.

*Stateless Widgets*:  
- *Layout Widgets* -> help with the arrangement of widgets. Examples:  
> - Column
> - Row
> - Stack
> - Container
> - SizedBox
> - Padding
- *Display Widgets* -> handle what the user sees onscreen. Examples:
> - Text
> - Image
> - Button

__MaterialApp__ is the predefined widget in Flutter (give a Material Design system look and feel)  
  > Among the most important attributes of Material there are:
  > 1. __title__ -> description that devices uses to identify the app - the UI won't display this.
  > 2. __theme__ -> determines visual aspects like colors and fonts.
  
__Scaffold__ widget provides the high-leve structure for a screen.  
  > Among the most important attributes of Scaffold there are:
  > 1. __appBar__ -> gets a title property by using a Text widget.
  > 2. __body__
  > 3. __bottomNavigationBar__
  > 4. __floatingActionButton__
  > 5. __snackBar__

- __Text__ ...
- __SafeArea__ keeps the app from getting too close to the operating system interfaces (notch, ...)
- __Image__ _Image.asset('path')_ or _Image(image: AssetImage('path'))_ with local images.
  > To use local images, in pubspec.yaml you have to add:  
  > assets:  
  >   - assets/  
    
- __ListView__ ...
- __SizedBox__ view with a fixed size.
- __Card__ Widget defines an area of UI where you've laid out related information about a specific 
  entity.
  > Among the most important attributes of Scaffold there are:
  > 1. __elevation__ -> determines how high off the screen the cars is (shadow changes).
  > 2. __shape__ -> handles the shape of the card.

- __Expanded__ Widget expands to fill the available space.


*Stateful Widgets*:  
- __GestureDetector__ detects gestures (_onTap()_, ...)
  > GestureDetector's child widget defines the area where the gesture is active.

> data model -> refers to classes - such as Car or Student  

> as you build large-scale apps, you'll start to compose a staircase of widgets. Widgets composed
> of other wodgets can get really long and messy. It's a good idea to break your widgets into
> separate files for readability.    

> __Theme.of(context)__ returns the nearest Theme in the widget tree. If the widget has a defined
> Theme, it return that. Otherwise, it returns the app's theme.  

> __setState()__ notifies the framework that the state of the object has changed, then rebuilds the
> widget internally.
